The dataset I chose to explore was the one titled Psychology+Cognition. My undergraduate degree was in psychology and I found cognitive psychology to be the most fascinating, not only because itâ€™s a branch of psychology with lots of new developments, but that itâ€™s astounding how quickly weâ€™re rethinking cognition. Information from this dataset could be anything from understanding addictive behavior at the cognitive level to how different types of music help concentration/task-completion. Having a list of cognitive studies around these topics could help anyone from educators to therapists continue to be updated in their practices.
Additional information that could be added to metadata of the dataset is: education, therapy, and learning.
Many of the papers are available by third party websites and can be read after a few clicks. Some papers only have metadata. 

The repositories I starred are those that would be helpful to my school librarian job. The getmetamapper would be interesting to learn for use of bettering metadata in our library catalog. I also found the introduction to web scraping fascinating. Being able to extract data from websites would be helpful prior to students using them as resources. I realize this is a slightly unnecessary step, but I think it would interesting to learn web scraping and see if it can be applied/educated to high school students in some way.
